# Introduction

The SimVascular **ROM Simulation Tool** is used to interactively create the geometry, boundary conditions and solver
parameters needed to execute a reduced-order model (ROM) simulation of 3D vascular networks. The reduced-order models
implemented in SimVascular use computationally inexpensive mathematical representations and reduced model dimensionality
to approximate the flow and pressure quantities in a cardiovascular system.

The SimVascular **sv1DSolver** solves for blood pressure and flow in deformable one-dimensional hemodynamic networks.
These equations offer a relatively efficient means to reproduce realistic wave propagation phenomemon in vascular networks.
One-dimensional networks can be coupled to both 0D lumped parameter models and to more complex 3D flow simulations as boundary
conditions.

The SimVascular **svZeroDSolver** solves for blood pressure and flow in a zero-dimensional spatial representation of
a vascular network modeled as an electrical circuit. The resistive, elastic and inertial properties of blood flow through
vessels are lumped into electrical elements. Although no spatial distribution of flow quantities is provided
this ROM can be complex enough to provide a good approximatation of circulatory dynamics.

## Centerlines Geometry

The geometry of the one-dimensional networks used by the **sv1DSolver** is based on the centerlines computed from the surface
of a 3D geometric model. The 3D geometric model is created from image data using the typical
SimVascular <a href="docsModelGuide.html"> modeling workflow </a>.

Centerlines represent a 1D characterization of blood vessel geometry. The centerlines are computed for a 3D surface using
the <a href="http://www.vmtk.org/tutorials/Centerlines.html"> Vascular Modeling Toolkit </a>. The computation solves a wave propagation
problem using a source point representing the start of the centerlines and target points representing the ends of the centerlines.
The source and target points are selected from the model caps defined in the SimVascular **Modeling Tool**.

### Network Geometry and 1D Simulation Mesh

The centerlines geometry is used to define network **nodes** at vessel inlets, outlets and branching points. A number of cylindrical
**segments** are defined representing the length and diameter between vessel **nodes**.

Segments are then discretized into a mesh of finite elements in order to numerically solve the 1D equations of fluid flow in
deformable vessels.

### Network Connectivity and 0D Simulation Circuit

The centerlines geometry is also used to define the connectivty for a 0D electrical circuit.

## Units

All model quantities and associated boundary conditions are specified in CGS units.
