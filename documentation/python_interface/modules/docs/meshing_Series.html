<pre class="PythonMethodsPre"><strong>Series</strong>(file_name) 

The meshing Series class provides an interface to SV time-varying meshes.  
A time series of meshes created from time-varying model data are stored in 
this class.                                                                

A Series object can be created with the name of an SV .msh meshing         
file. The file is read and a Mesh object is created for each time point    
defined in the file.                                                       

Example: Creating a Series object from a .msh file                         

    mesh_series = sv.meshing.Series("demo.msh")                          

Args:
  file_name (Optional[str]): The name of an SV .msh meshing file.          </pre>

<legend style="font-size:20px; text-align:left"> <b> Methods </b> </legend> 
<pre class="PythonMethodsPre"><strong>get_mesh</strong>(time=0) 
   
   Get the mesh object for the given time. The meshing options read from   
   the SV mesh .msh file are also returned.                                
   
   Example: Getting the mesh and options for time 0                        
   
       mesh, options = mesh_series(time=0)                                 
   
   Args: 
     time (Optional[int]): The time to get the mesh for.                    
         0 <= time < number of time points in the series.                   
   
   Returns mesher and options objects for the meshing kernel defined for    
       the series. 
</pre> 
<br>
<pre class="PythonMethodsPre"><strong>get_num_times</strong>() 
   
   Get the number of time points in the series. 
   
   Returns (int): The number of time points in the series.
</pre> 
<br>
<pre class="PythonMethodsPre"><strong>write</strong>(file_name) 
   
   Write the mesh group to an SV .msh file.
   
   Args: 
     file_name (str): The name of the file to write the mesh group to. 
</pre>
