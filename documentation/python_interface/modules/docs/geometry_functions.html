     use_distance (Optional[bool]): If True then align profile initial     
       points using the minium distance between points. If False then align
       profile initial points using the angle beteenn points.

<pre class="PythonMethodsPre"><strong>loft</strong>
   loft(polydata_list, loft_options) 
   
   Create a lofted surface from a list of polydata curves.                  
   
   The loft method fits a surface through two or more profile curves that   
   define the surface shape. This is typically used to create a surface of  
   a vessel from a group of contours segmenting the vessel's lumen.         
   
   The surface is created using splines interpolating profile points along  
   the its length and linearly interpolation around its profile.            
   
   Args: 
     polydata_list (list[vtkPolyData]): The list of vtkPolyData objects     
        representing the profile curves defining a surface.                 
     loft_options (sv.geometry.LoftOptions): The LoftOptions object         
        containing lofting parameter values.                                
   
   Returns (vtkPolyData): The vtkPolyData object of the lofted surface.

<pre class="PythonMethodsPre"><strong>loft_nurbs</strong>
   loft_nurbs(polydata_list, loft_options) 
   
   Create a lofted NURBS surface from a list of polydata curves.            
   
   The loft method fits a surface through two or more profile curves that   
   define the surface shape. This is typically used to create a surface of  
   a vessel from a group of contours segmenting the vessel's lumen.         
   
   Args: 
     polydata_list (list[vtkPolyData]): The list of vtkPolyData objects     
        representing the profile curves defining a surface.                 
     loft_options (sv.geometry.LoftNurbsOptions): The LoftNurbsOptions      
        object containing lofting parameter values.

<pre class="PythonMethodsPre"><strong>point_inside</strong>
   point_inside(polydata, point) 
   
   Determine if a 3D point is inside or outside of a solid.                
   
   Args: 
     polydata (vtkPolyData): The vtkPolyData object representing a solid   
        as a closed surface
