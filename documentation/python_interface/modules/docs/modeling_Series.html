<pre class="PythonMethodsPre">SimVascular modeling Series class. 

Series(file_name) 

The modeling Series class provides an interface to SV time-varying       
models. Models created from time-varying image data are stored in this   
class.                                                                   

A Series object can be created with the name of an SV .mdl modelinng     
file. The file is read and Model objects are created for each time       
point defined in the file.                                               

Example: Creating a modeling Series object from a .mdl file              

    model_series = sv.modeling.Series("demo.mdl")                      

Args:
  file_name (Optional[str]): The name of an SV .mdl modeling file.       </pre>

<pre class="PythonMethodsPre"><strong>get_model</strong>(time=0) 
   
   Get the solid model object for a given time. 
   
   Args: 
     time Optional[int]): The time step to get the solid model for. 
         0 <= time < number of time points in the series.           
   
   Returns (ModelingModel object): The ModelingModel object for the solid model.
</pre> 
<br>
<pre class="PythonMethodsPre"><strong>get_num_times</strong>() 
  
   Get the number of time points in the series. 
   
   Returns (int): The number of time points in the series.
</pre> 
<br>
<pre class="PythonMethodsPre"><strong>write</strong>(file_name) 
   
   Write the modeling group to an SV .mdl format file.
   
   The .mdl file stores modeling group data in an XML format that 
   that can be read by SV into a SV Modeling node. 
   
   Args: 
     file_name (str): The name of the file to write the modeling group to.
