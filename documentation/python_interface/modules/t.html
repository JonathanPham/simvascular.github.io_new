The pathplanning module provides an interface for SV path planning. Paths  model vessel centerlines using a small number of manually selected 
control points. Path geometry is represented by a set of curve points sampled from a spline passing through the control points. Path curve 
points are used to postition a slice plane for image segmentaion.

<!---           add_control_point           ---> 
<pre class="PythonMethodsPre">
<strong>add_control_point(point, index=None) </strong> 

   Add a control point to a path. 
 
   The point is inserted into the path's list of control points at the location to the control point it is closest to.  
   If the 'location' argument is given then the point is added at that location in the list. 
 
   Args: 
     point (list[float,float,float]): The control point (x,y,z) coordinates. 
     index (Optional[int]): The index into the current list of control points to add the control point. 0 <= index <= number of path control points - 1
</pre>

<pre class="PythonMethodsPre">
<strong>get_control_points() </strong> 

   Get the path's control points. 
   
   Returns (list(list[float,float,float])): The list of the path's control points. 
</pre>


<pre class="PythonMethodsPre">
<strong>get_curve_frame(index) </strong> 
   
   Get the coordinate frame at the path's interpolating curve at a given location. 
   
   Args: 
     index (int): The index into the path's curve frames. 0 <= index <= number of path curve frames - 1. 
   
   Returns (list([float,float,float])): The path's curve normal at the given location.
