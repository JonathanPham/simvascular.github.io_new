###Console Mode 
All of the built-in modules are available from the standard library that is distributed with Python. Modules can be imported and used just like any typical Python
application. Commands can be interactively typed in and executed by pressing return.

The SimVascular <b>Console</b> does not support automatic indentation to mark blocks of code. Indented code blocks defined by the <b>:</b> delimiter
(.e.g. if-statements, for-loops and function definitions) cannot be used as they normally would in an interactive Python session. The console interpreter
executes each command after a return and does not store commands after a <b>:</b> delimiter to execute as a code block. For for-loops this limitation can be
overcome using list comprehension but in general it is better to use the <b>Text Editor</b> for creating scripts.
