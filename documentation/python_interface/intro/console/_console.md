located at the far right end on the SimVascular tool bar. The **Python Console** has two panels.
The right panel is used to execute commands by the Python interpreter.

The left panel lists the currently defined Python attributes (variables). Importing a module adds that module name to the list of attributes. Importing
all of the <b>sv</b> modules by typing <b>from sv import \*</b> in the interpreter panel adds all of the modules defined by <b>sv</b> to the list of attributes
in the left panel.

The <b>Python Console</b> has two modes of operation: <b>Console</b> and <b>Text Editor</b>. The <b>Python Console</b> opens in <b>Console</b> mode
that is used to interactively execute Python commands. The version of the Python interpreter embedded in the SimVascular application is printed
and the Python **>>>** prompt is displayed meaning that the interpreter is ready for keyboard input. The <b>Console</b> and <b>Text Editor</b>
buttons located at the bottom of the right panel are used to select the operational mode.
