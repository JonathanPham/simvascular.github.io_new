NAME
    sv - SimVascular Python API

DESCRIPTION
    The sv package provides an application programming interface (API) for accessing core 
    SimVascular functions. The API defines a number of Python modules and classes used to 
    access, manipulate and create data for each of the path planning, segmentation, modeling, 
    mesh generation and simulation steps in the SimVascular image-based modeling pipeline. 
    Custom Python scripts can be written to augment the functionality provided by the 
    SimVascular GUI and to automate modeling tasks for optimization, uncertainty quantification, 
    and studies with large patient cohorts.
    
    The sv package defines the following modules

      dmg - Access to SV Data Manager nodes 
      geometry - Functions operating on VTK PolyData objects 
      meshing - Classes and methods for meshing 
      modeling - Classes and methods for modeling 
      pathplanning - Classes and methods for path plannning 
      segmentation - Classes and methods for segmentation 
      vmtk - Interrface to several VMTK funcntions
