## Python Shell

The SimVascular **Python Shell** provides a Python interface to SimVascular without the GUI. The **Python Shell** is invoked from a
terminal by executing the script used to launch SimVascular interactively. The launch script is located in the SimVascular install
directory and is executed for different platforms using

<pre>
Linux: /usr/local/sv/simvascular/<em>DATE</em>/simvascular 

MacOS: /usr/local/sv/simvascular/<em>DATE</em>/simvascular 

Windows: C:\Program Files\SimVascular\SimVascular\<em>DATE</em>\sv.bat  
</pre>

where <em>DATE</em> is the SimVascular install date (e.g. 2020-04-06). In the following discussion we will use **simvascular** to represent the
the SimVascular launch script.

<br>
The SimVascular Python interpreter, the application that executes Python programs, is invoked in interactive mode using the **---python** flag.
That means you can enter Python statements or expressions interactively and have them executed or evaluated while you wait.
The **Python Shell** behaves like the standard Python interpreter and therefore supports automatic indentation to mark blocks of code.

The **Python Shell** is terminated using

<pre>
Linux and MacOS: Ctrl-D 

Windows: exit() or hold the Ctrl key down while you enter a Z, then hit the “Enter” key to get back to your Windows command prompt
</pre>

<br>
Python scripts are read in and executed using a double-dash **---** before the script name. The **Python Shell** passes the script to the 
Python interpreter for execution and then exits.
