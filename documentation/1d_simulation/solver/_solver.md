The one-dimensional equations for the flow of a Newtonian, incompressible fluid
in a deforming, elastic domain consist of the continuity equation, a single axial momentum balance equation, a constitutive
equation, and suitable initial and boundary conditions. The governing equations are derived in a general form by 
Hughes[2] and Hughes and Lubliner[1].
