### Creating a PolyData Model from 3D Segmentations

This exercise will use 3D segmentation to create a solid model.

**To create a PolyData model (empty):**

    Right click the data node "Models" in the SV project in Data Manager
    Click "Create Model" in the popup menu
    Model Type: PolyData
    Model Name: model_from_3dseg
    Click "OK"

Now a new data node “model_from_3dseg” for the model is created under the data node "Models" in Data Manager. Double click the data node “model_from_3dseg" and the tool "SV Modeling” automatically shows up. The new model is empty and has no data so far.

**Use 3D segmentation to create model:**

    Click the button "Create Model..."
    A dialog pops up, showing all available groups
    Toggle on the check boxes in the column "Use" for the 3D segmentation you want
    Click "OK"

After the model is created, you should now be able to see one face named as "wall-seg3d" created for the model. The model surface may be not very desirable and not have flat faces for the vessel ends. So we'll continue to process this model.

**Smooth**

    Global Ops -> WS Smooth -> Click the button "Smooth"
    Global Ops -> Densify -> Num Divisions: 1, Click the button "Subdivide"

**Trim and Fill**

    Trim -> use a plane or box to trim the vessel, try to make the cutting plane perpendicular to the vessel
    Global Ops ->  Fill Holes w/o ID

**Extract Faces**

    Face Ops -> Extract -> Click the button "Extract Faces"
    Remember to assign a type (wall or cap) for those faces

**Remesh**
If you show the model edges, the surface mesh may be too fine or not desirable to you. You can do remeshing:

    Global Ops -> Remesh -> Click "Estimate Size" or provide a proper value, click the button "Remesh"

**Extract Centerlines**

As now you have a nice model with faces extracted with type(wall/cap) info, you can extract paths (centerlines) for this model

    Right click the model "model_from_3dseg" in Data Manager
    Click "Extract Paths" in the popup menu
