# Solve Cardiac Mechanics with svFSI #

Solving cardiac mechanics is a challenging task as the heart muscle is a complex fibrous structure that is predominantly incompressible <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>, and undergoes large deformation during a cardiac cycle. In the following sections, we will introduce the workflow of modeling cardiac mechanics in **svFSI** using the benchmark example from Land et al. <a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>, i.e., the passive inflation of an idealized left ventricle.
