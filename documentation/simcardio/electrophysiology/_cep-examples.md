## Examples ##

In this section, we will provide two examples of cardiac electrophysiology modeling. The first example is a widely used benchmark test, activation of a block of cardiac tissue <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. The second example is the propagation of action potential in the Purkinje fibers. More examples are available on <a href="https://github.com/SimVascular/svFSI-Tests/tree/master/08-cep">GitHub</a>.
