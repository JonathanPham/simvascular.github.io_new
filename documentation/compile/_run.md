## Running SimVascular

To run SimVascular and other executables you need to run the startup script which will set up the environmnet variables and start the executable. These scripts should be run from the top level of the build directory:

<table class="table table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Executable</th>
  <th>Linux/OSX Script</th>
  <th>Windows Script</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
  <td>SimVascular</td>
  <td>mysim</td>
  <td>mysim.bat</td>
</tr>
</table>
