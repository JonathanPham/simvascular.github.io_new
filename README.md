# SimVascular Website

This is the repository for the SimVascular website.

## Usage

The SimVascular website documentation can be found in the documentation folder, and the SimVascular website clinical test cases can be found in the clinical folder. In each folder, there are `html` files and their corresponding folder, which share the same name. For example, the folder associated with the `quickguide.html` file is named quickguide.

In each folder, there are markdown files from which the content in the `html` files is generated. [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax that can be editied using a text editor.

The markdown files are accessed and translated into `html` through the `<zero-md>` element, which is placed in the `html` file. Documentation on `<zero-md>` can be found [here](https://zerodevx.github.io/zero-md/).

Before editing, you should first fork **simvascular.github.io** to your own repository and sync it with https://github.com/SimVascular/simvascular.github.io.
